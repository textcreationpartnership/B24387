            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">M</seg>Y Pen is unable to express how much my heart hath been, and is obliged to your Lordships service; who ever since you were our most Reverend and Honoured Father and Governour, have declared your self the Pillar of the Church, in your Lordships Diocess, the Patron of your conformable and vertuous Clergy, and the great and good Example of Piety, Justice, Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, and Religious Devotion.</p>
            <p>The present demonstration of this my cordial ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, is a Sermon preached this last Assize in your Lordships Diocess; the which (confiding in your Lordships obliging candour) presumes to kiss your Lordships hands in this publick address.</p>
            <p>I hope there can be no Solecism herein, upon the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count either of Divinity or Morality; for one Subject
<pb facs="tcp:206214:4"/> of the Sermon is Religion, whose beautifull face would be not only sullied by the foul fingers of defor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med Errors, but also wofully scratched, and misera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly torn by the poysonous nails of many-headed Schism, and monstrous Heresies, unless the<note n="a" place="margin">Apud nos, Apostolorum locum Episco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pi tenent.

            </p>
            <p>As also, another Branch of this Discourse is King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Government, the real interest whereof is so twisted with the sacred Order of Bishops, that it seems ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated by the same Soul; for like <hi>Hippocrates</hi> twins, they smile and weep together, and live and die toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: the which most certain truth was too truly and plainly demonstrated in the late schismatical times, which sealed with sacred blood that<note n="a" place="margin">Confer. at Hampt.

            <p>A third Branch of the Sermon is, the Supremacy of his Majesty, in Causes Ecclesiastical; of which Royal Prerogative, inherent in the Imperial Crown, the Protestant Bishops have alwayes been the most faithfull and worthy<note n="b" place="margin">Episc.

            <p>The last Branch concerns the Law, which is <hi>Vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culum Humanae Societatis,</hi> and concerns Magistracy,
<pb facs="tcp:206214:4"/> which is <hi>Propugnaculum Legis,</hi> to whose due Rights none tender a more cheerfull and ready obedience, than those of the Episcopal judgement, who preach and practice passive obedience, not<note n="c" place="margin">Cal.

I proceed to the other kind of Judges, which are Civil, of which my Text directly speaks—
<q>He set Judges in the Land.</q>
            </p>
            <p>And what are Civil Judges? They are the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured Fathers of their Countrey, the worthy Patrons of the Subjects Birth-right, which is Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety, and legal Liberty; and as the holy<note n="a" place="margin">Psal. 47.9.</note> Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture calls them, <gap reason="foreign">

            <pb n="15" facs="tcp:206214:12"/>
            <p>Judges are the <hi>Atlas</hi>'s which bear up the pillars of a flourishing Nation; the Altars to which the desolate Widow, the forlorn Orphan, and the distressed Innocent fly for succour; and they are the Oracles of Law, from whose well-guided Lips the Princes of the Earth learn Wisdome and Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness.</p>
            <p>They are so extreamly necessary, that not only the Well-being of a Kingdome, but the very Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of humane Society depends upon them. So that what some Modern Philosophers say of the Sun, namely,<note place="margin">Rob. de fluct. in utriusque cosmi. hist. tract 1. lib. 1. cap. 6.</note> That if that glorious Planet was pulled out of his Sphear, by the hand of Omnipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, the lovely frame of Heaven and Earth would sink into a Chaos: So we may confidently say, that if Judges and Magistrates were thrown out of the Seat of Government, and levelled with the <hi>Vulgus,</hi> by the evil spirit of <hi>Quakerism, Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptism,</hi> and <hi>Enthusiasm,</hi> all humane Society would quickly corrupt into self-destroying Confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, and be swallowed up in the gaping gulph of Oppression, Violence, and ruining Misery.</p>
            <p>How happy then are we of this Kingdome, <hi>Bona si sua norint Agricolae,</hi> if we had Eyes to see our Happiness, that we have Judges and Magistrates in the Land: That we are not left like the harm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less Dove, to the greedy violence of Birds of prey; that we are not left as the quiet Sheep, to the gri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping

            <p>Finally, what great cause have we to magnifie God, for this Happiness of the Kingdome, far above other Kingdomes in the world, that these honourable and learned Judges of our Land, do like the Vine and Fig-tree in<note n="c" place="margin">Judg. 9.10.</note>

               <hi>Moses,</hi> sit from Morning to Evening, to hear the Causes between man and man. And this brings me to the third part of the Text, the Judges Circuit,—
<q>
                  <pb n="17" facs="tcp:206214:13"/>Throughout all the fenced Cities of Judah.<note place="margin">The third part of the Text.</note>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>But what have fenced Cities to do with Judges? Fenced Cities have need of valiant Souldiers, and experienced Commanders; have need of swelling Granaries, and loaden Magazins; have need of <hi>Vitruvius,</hi> to build strong Bulwarks; and of<note n="a" place="margin">De Archime<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de.

               <hi>Archimedes,</hi> to draw Geometricall lines. <hi>Juli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us Caesar</hi> told the honest Tribune, who forbad him to break open the <hi>Roman</hi> Treasury, because it was against Law;<note n="b" place="margin">Plut. in vita Julii Caesar.</note>
               <hi>Julius Caesar</hi> told him, that <hi>the shrill sound of the Trumpet, and the ratling beat of the Drum, did so deafen his Ears, that he could not hear the voice of any Law.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Yet notwithstanding all this, and much more that might be said, there is great necessity and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundant advantage, when Judges are appointed to visit all the fenced Cities of <hi>Judah.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For a City may be fenced in the <hi>Halcyon</hi> dayes of Peace; a City may be fortified, when the Temple of <hi>Janus</hi> is shut; and the politick Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of Princes teacheth them, to provide as well against the Fraud of a pretended Ally, as against the watchfull Malice of a proclaimed Enemy. It is something too late to draw Fortifications, when the Herald denounces Warre, and the Canon spits fire: And therefore<note n="c" place="margin">2 Reg. 23.9. 2 Chron. 19.15, 16. 2 Chron. 26.14, 17.</note>

<pb n="18" facs="tcp:206214:14"/> Preventing Physick is the cheapest and the best Physick.</p>
            <p>Now in this case, Judges are as needfull and usefull for fenced Cities, as their deep Trenches, and double Walls: Nay, they are more needfull, and more strong defences, than all their Walls of Stone or Earth; stronger than that brazen Wall, which common fame relates, the learned Frier en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured by Magical skill to erect round about this famous Island.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Lycurgus</hi> the renowned Law-maker of <hi>Sparta</hi> was clearly of this judgement, and therefore<note n="d" place="margin">Plut. in vita Lycur.</note> for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bad his Citizens to build any Walls about their <hi>Sparta,</hi> affirming, that <hi>good Laws duely executed were the strongest monuments to Towns or Cities;</hi> the which Truth was confirmed by real Experience, for (as <hi>Plutarch</hi> observes) <hi>Sparta,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Plut. in vita Lysandri.</note> which had no Walls, but good Laws, was longer lived, and more illustrious than <hi>Thebes,</hi> or <hi>Corinth,</hi> or <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens,</hi> or any other City of <hi>Greece,</hi> which had sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed invincible Fortifications.</p>
            <p>And this Truth is establisht by solid Reason: For as Impostumes within the Body, if they are not cured, do more certainly kill, than loathed Ul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers that are in the external parts: And as infect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed blood running in the channell of the Veins doth more speedily transfix the heart, than wide wounds which are exposed to the Eye; so Divisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:206214:14"/> and Oppression, and Riots, and Debauche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, and sordid vices within a City, do more certainly and speedily ruine a fenced City or Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poration, than <hi>Hannibal ante portas,</hi> than a threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Enemy that beleaguers the Walls, or a bold Foe that throws a Granado into the Town, or strikes a Petard upon the Gates.</p>
            <p>Needfull then are Judges, even in fenced Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, that they may be Healers of in-bred Divisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, Repairers of tumultuous Breaches, and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storers of quiet paths to dwell in.</p>
            <p>Necessary be Judges, that they may charm with the rod of <hi>Mercury,</hi> the evil spirit of Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, and punish with the glittering Sword of Justice, the impudence of incorrigible Offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors. They are necessary to protect the Gown from the Buff; to shelter the un-armed Towns<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, from the imperiousness and rapine of the Man of Warre, who would roar and swell like the raging Waves of the Sea, if Judges and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours did not with the Trident of Law, as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swage the fury of the thundring Tempest.— But my Text goes further—
<q>City by City.</q> that is to say, Every City had Judges appointed for the composing of civil differences, and the punishing of notorious malefactours. <q>

               <hi>Grotius</hi> observes upon the Text.</p>
            <p>And this was a singular act of Prudence: For if there be no City, Town, or Corporation, (except in Sr. <hi>Thomas Moor</hi>'s <hi>Eutopia</hi>) which is priviledged in a moral sence, as<note n="b" place="margin">Heylins Cos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mogr. de Creta &amp; Hibernia.</note>
               <hi>Creet</hi> and <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> are in an historical sense, from venemous Creatures; then there is an absolute necessity of providing the antidote of Law, and the amulet of Justice for every City, that the Good and Vertu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous be not stung to death by the flying Serpent of Oppression, or gnawn to the bones by the weep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Crocodile of Hypocrisie.</p>
            <p>Poets do<note n="c" place="margin">Hefiod. Virg. Ovid, &amp;c,</note> fable of the Golden Age, that it flourished <hi>sine Lege, &amp; sine Judice,</hi> without Law, or Judges; and that Men were then so vertuous, that— <q>

                     <hi>Vindice nullo</hi>

                  <l>Sponte sua, sine lege, fidem, rectumque tenebant,</l>
                  <l>—Paena metusque aberant.</l>
               </q> that men in those ancient times were honest and faithfull of themselves; and that they were just without paenal Laws, or fear of punishment. But that Age of Innocency is long ago expired, and we live in the Iron Age, where<note n="d" place="margin">Facit indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natio Versum. Juvenal.

            </q>
            <p>And therefore there is extream need of Judges, and of Law, that the <hi>Augaean</hi> Stable may be cleansed; the stinking sinks of foul sins may be washed; that men may not be Cannibals, or else turn Brutes, and be like Monsters to tear and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour one another.</p>
            <p>For the body politick is in many regards like the body natural: And as the body natural doth every year contract some ill humours, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore hath sometimes need of incision, sometimes of purgation, sometimes of breathing a Vein, and sometimes of Causticks, and sometimes of the amputating Saw, <hi>Ne pars sincera trahatur,</hi> lest the sound parts be gangreen'd; so it is in a City or Corporation, the diseases of Impiety and Iniquity abound, and like the crawling Insects breed and multiply of themselves: and therefore there is a necessity of Judges and Magistrates, to be the blessed <hi>Aesculapius</hi>'s to cure all these destroying Maladies; to cure the Tympany of<note n="a" place="margin">Haec sunt septem pecca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta capitalia, ut numerantur à Canisio in cat. pag. 455.</note> Pride, the Dropsie of Covetousness, the Itch of Luxury, the Impostume of Envy, the <hi>Caninus appetitus</hi> of Gluttony, the Feaver of Wrath, and the Lethargy of Idleness.</p>
            <p>Need of Judges itinerant to visit a Kingdome, City by City, that they may cure the Megrim of
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:206214:16"/> Disloyalty, the Leprosie of Schism, the Frenzy of Quarrelling, the stinking Breath of false Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, the Rheum of railing Language, and the Palsie of a lying Tongue.</p>
            <p>Who knows not that Cities and Corporations are as Common-shores, wherein the filth of a Kingdome runs? As great Rivers, which admit the streams of any muddy Rivulet to mingle with them; as vast boyling Pots, wherein there ariseth naturally abundance of Scum.</p>
            <p>In a Kingdome there is foul-mouth'd Swearing, Heaven-provoking Cursing, swinish Drinking, abominable Cheating, injurious Bargaining, false Conveyances, pretended Titles, cursed failing in Trust.</p>
            <p>In a Kingdome there are bloody Murthers, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poverishing Thefts, frighting Burglaries, Soul-destroying Perjury, Religion-ruining Simony, execrable Treasons, and detestable Sacriledge.</p>
            <p>Wherefore it is necessary to have Law and Judges in the Land, that these Impostumes may be launced, that these Ulcers may be cured, that these pestilential Humours may be emptied, and these epidemical Diseases may be thorowly pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged by the soveraign Pill of Justice, Righteousness, and Equity.</p>
            <p>And it is high time that these ill Humours of Vice and Wickedness be evacuated: For what a

            <p>What a dismall Prognostication for the whole Kingdome is the slighting of Authority, the speaking evil of Dignities, the murmuring of <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rah</hi>'s, the whispering of <hi>Miriam</hi>'s, the refusing the Waters of <hi>Siloam,</hi> which run softly, and the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patient longings after the puddles of levelling Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment in the Church, as the fickle and giddy <hi>Israelites</hi> did once long after the stinking Leeks and Onions of <hi>Egypt.</hi>

            <p>And doubtless it is most safe for Judges and Magistrates, <hi>Venienti occurrere Morbo,</hi> to meet a Disease, before the Malignity of it hath seized the Vitals; and to destroy the Cockatrice, whilest it is in the shell.
